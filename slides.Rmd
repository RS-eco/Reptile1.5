## Questions

*  Q1: How is global reptile species richness affected by climate change?

--

* Q2: Which regions are specifically affected?

--

*  Q3: How is changing species related to changes in precipitation and temperature?

--

*  Q4: How is the range extent and range overlap affected by climate change?

--

*  Q5: How is the range position affected by climate change and how does this differ among regions? 

--

*  Q6: How do climatic conditions change across modelled and non-modelled species?

## Methods – Species distributions

*  Global Assessment of Reptile Distributions (Roll et al. 2017)

    - Global range maps of 10064 reptile species

    - 3 subgroups: 6415 lizards, 3414 snakes, and 235 turtles

    - ca. 45 % more species than IUCN range maps!

#--
    - **gridded to 0.5°**

#--

*  Pseudo-absences:

    - distance-weighted randomly selected grid cells

    - n = number of presences, but minimum 1000 cells

    - repeated 10 times

#---

## Methods – Climate Data

*  Current:

    - EWEMBI climate data (0.5°, Lange 2017)

    - Daily observed temperature and precipitation over 30-yr time period (1980 - 2009)

=> **19 bioclimatic variables for 1 time period**

#--

*  Future:

    - CMIP5 simulated climate data (0.5°, Frieler et al. 2017)

    - 4 Global Climate Models (GCMs): GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC5

    - 3 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP2.6, RCP6.0, RCP8.5

    - 2 x 30-yr time periods: 2050 (2036 - 2065), 2080 (2066 – 2095)

=> **19 bioclim variables for 12 scenarios and 2 time periods**

## Methods – Species Distribution Models

```{r, echo=F, out.width = "55%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/SDM_Method.png")
```

*  Explanatory variable: (Bio)climatic information (1980 - 2009)
*  Response variable: Presence/Absence of species (gridded range maps)

<!--
#---

## Methods – Models

*  Variable Selection:
    
    - Pre-selection of 10 most-commonly used variables
    
    - Identify possible combinations of 3 & 4 variables with a low Pearson correlation (p < 0.7)

#--

*  Identify optimal variable combination:
    
    - combination with highest accuracy out of 36 tested combinations
    
    - tested on 10 % of all species using GAMs

=> **4 bioclimatic variables: bio4 = Temperature seasonality, bio5 = Max temperature of warmest month, bio12 = Annual precipitation, bio15 = Precipitation seasonality**

#---

## Methods – Models

*   Model algorithms:
    
    - Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
    
    - Generalized Boosted Regression Models (GBMs)

#--

*  Spatial autocorrelation
    
    - Spatial blocking (n > 50): 10 blocks, representative climate space per ecoregion => N = ...
    
    - 30/70 Split (n ≤ 50) => N = ...
    
    - Species with n < 10 were removed (N = ...)
    
#--

*  Model accuracy
    
    - Only keep species with average model accuracy > 0.7

=> **100 models per species (N = 6296)**
-->

## Methods – Analysis

*  **Predict** models to current and future conditions (48 scenarios: 4 GCMs, 3 RCPs, 2 Years, 2 Model algorithms)

--

*  **Threshold** species-specific predictions to binary values, using true skill statistic (TSS)

--

*  **Dispersal ability** is restricted using species-species buffers:
    - 3 different dispersal scenarios (d/4, d/8, d/16 where d is the range diameter)

## Methods – Analysis

*  Calculate increase, decrease and net change in species richness

#--

*  Compare richness changes among zoogeographic realms and the different taxonomic groups

#--

*  Define common grid cell according to climatic space (temperature and precipitation) and calculate the change in richness for each combination of conditions

#--

*  Calculate species-specific change in extent of occurrence and the directional shift in occurrence (still to be completed)

## Summary

*  Q1: Area that decreases in reptile richness is larger than area where richness increases and decrease is often more pronounced.

--

*  Q2: Reptile richness significantly declines with increasing warming globally and across most zoogeographic realms.

--

*  Q3: Strongest changes mostly occur in extreme temperature and precipitation conditions.

--

*  Q4: Changes in extent of occurrence are negatively skewed. And a lot of species loss a significant proportion of the original range extent.

--

*  Q5: Changes in range position strongly varied across taxa and realm, with a northward shift in lizards and a southward shift in snakes and turtles.

--

*  Q6: Non-modeled species are stronger affected by climatic changes than modeled species.
