**Running head:** Global reptiles under climate change

## Abstract

**Aim:** Until recently, complete information on global reptile
distributions has not been widely available. Here, we provide the first
comprehensive climate impact assessment for reptiles on a global scale.

**Location:** Global, excluding Antarctica

**Time period:** 1995, 2050, 2080

**Major taxa studied:** Reptiles

**Methods:** We modelled the distribution of 6,296 reptile species and
assessed potential global as well as realm-specific changes in species
richness, the change in global species richness across climate space,
and species-specific changes in range extent, overlap and position under
future climate change. To assess the future climatic impact on 3,768
range-restricted species, which could not be modelled, we compared the
future change in climatic conditions between both modelled and
non-modelled species.

**Results:** Reptile richness was projected to decline significantly
over time, globally but also for most zoogeographic realms, with the
greatest decrease in Brazil, Australia and South Africa. Species
richness was highest in warm and moist regions, with these regions being
projected to shift further towards climate extremes in the future. Range
extents were projected to decline considerably in the future, with a low
overlap between current and future ranges. Shifts in range centroids
differed among realms and taxa, with a dominating global poleward shift.
Non-modelled species were significantly stronger affected by projected
climatic changes than modelled species.

**Main conclusions:** With ongoing future climate change, reptile
richness is likely to decrease significantly across most parts of the
world. This effect as well as considerable impacts on species’ range
extent, overlap, and position were visible across lizards, snakes and
turtles alike. Together with other anthropogenic impacts, such as
habitat loss and harvesting of species, this is a cause for concern.
Given the historical lack of global reptile distributions, this calls
for a re-assessment of global reptile conservation efforts, with a
specific focus on anticipated future climate change.

terrestrial reptile species richness (1995), b) frequency of species
richness by taxonomic group (lizard, snake, turtle and total) with mean
values highlighted by vertical line and c) increase, d) decrease, e) net
change and f) relative change (%) in reptile species richness for all
modelled reptile species (N = 6296) for the year 2080 under a medium
representative concentration pathway (RCP6.0) and a medium dispersal
scenario (d/8). Results are presented as the ensemble mean, across the
four global circulation models (GCMs) and two model algorithms (GAM &
GBM) considered. All maps are based on 0.5° x 0.5° grid cells, which
have been projected to Mollweide equal‐area projection (EPSG:54009).
Grey areas are regions for which no projections are available. Note that
the colour scales differ among the individual panels.

richness across the globe and for each zoogeographic realm
(Afrotropical, Australian, Madagascan, Nearctic, Neotropical, Oceanian,
Oriental, Palearctic, Panamanian, Saharo-Arabian & Sino-Japanese) over
time (1995, 2080) based on all modelled reptile species (N = 6296).
Results are presented as the ensemble mean across the four global
circulation models (GCMs) and two model algorithms (GAM & GBM)
considered, under a medium representative concentration pathway (RCP6.0)
and a medium dispersal scenario (d/8). The statistical difference
between years was tested using a paired Student’s t-test with Holm
correction (p \< 0.05 = *, p \< 0.01 = **, p \< 0.001 = ***, p \< 0.0001
= \*\*\*\*). Plots show mean (red point & label), median (black
horizontal line), 25th to 75th percentiles (box), entire range of data
(violin & data points) and density of values (width of violin). Figure 5
provides a map outlining the different zoogeographic realms.

Heat maps and lines show the mean and ribbons the standard deviation in
variance across space, global circulation models (GCMs) and the two

turtle) per potential range overlap class (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80,
80-100). Error margins/bars indicate the standard deviation across the
four global circulation models (GCMs) and the two model algorithms (GAM
& GBM) used. Both shown for 2080 under a medium representative
concentration pathway (RCP6.0) and a medium dispersal scenario (d/8).

of potential range centroid changes per taxonomic group (a) lizard, b)

ensemble mean across the four global circulation models (GCMs) and two
model algorithms (GAM & GBM) considered, for the year 2080 under a
medium representative concentration pathway (RCP6.0) and a medium
dispersal scenario (d/8). The inset bar chart shows the number of
species that have their range centroid located in the respective realm.
Numbers show the total number of species per realm, while the bars are
colour coded by the three different taxonomic groups. Please note that a
considerable number of species (n = 518) have their range centroid
located outside of the zoogeographic realm boundaries and thus were not
associated with any realm and so are not considered for the polar plots
in Fig. 5 d).

\< 0.0001 = \*\*\*\*). Plots show mean (red point & label), median
