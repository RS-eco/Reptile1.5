## Appendix S1 Methodological details

**Table S1.1.** Description of the 19 bioclimatic variables used for variable selection in our modelling approach, calculated with the biovars() function from the `dismo` package in R. Bioclimatic variables are derived from monthly minimum and maximum temperature as well as precipitation data in order to generate more biologically meaningful variables. The bioclimatic variables represent annual trends, seasonality and extreme or limiting environmental factors. A quarter is a period of three months (1/4 of the year).

| **Variable abbreviation** | **Variable description** |
|:--------------------------|:-------------------------|
| BIO1 | Annual Mean Temperature |
| BIO2 | Mean Diurnal Range (Mean of monthly (max temp - min temp)) |
| BIO3 | Isothermality (BIO2/BIO7) (×100) |
| BIO4 | Temperature Seasonality (standard deviation ×100) |
| BIO5 | Max Temperature of Warmest Month |
| BIO6 | Min Temperature of Coldest Month |
| BIO7 | Temperature Annual Range (BIO5-BIO6) |
| BIO8 | Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter |
| BIO9 | Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter |
| BIO10 | Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter |
| BIO11 | Mean Temperature of Coldest Quarter |
| BIO12 | Annual Precipitation |
| BIO13 | Precipitation of Wettest Month |
| BIO14 | Precipitation of Driest Month |
| BIO15 | Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation) |
| BIO16 | Precipitation of Wettest Quarter |
| BIO17 | Precipitation of Driest Quarter |

**Figure S1.1.** Various (Top10) non-correlated combinations of three and four bioclimatic variables and their rank of model performance across a representative subset of species (see Hof et al.

**Figure S1.2.** Model performance (AUC) for the different reptile groups (a) lizard, b) snake, c), turtle, d) total) for each of the two model algorithms (GAM, GBM) used. AUC values are only shown for models used in the analysis, hence only values >= .7 are shown, as species which had models with a lower performance were removed from the analysis. See Table 1 for an overview on the number of species removed due to a low AUC. The statistical difference between GAM and GBM models was tested using a paired Student's t-test with Holm correction (p < .05 = \*, p < .01 = \*\*, p < .001 = \*\*\*, p < .0001 = \*\*\*\*). Plots show mean (red point & label), median (black horizontal line), 25th to 75th percentiles (box), entire range of data (violin & data points) and density of values (width of violin).

**Figure S1.3.** Range-based observed species richness (gridded to 0.5°) versus projected current species richness for each grid cell per taxon (a) lizard, b) snake, c) turtle and d) total) for ensemble models (average among model algorithms). Thresholded sum of species occurrence per grid cell is shown in red, while the sum of species probability per grid cell is shown in blue. Stacked species distribution models (S-SDMs) were performed using a medium dispersal scenario (d/8). Perfect fits would have intercepts of 0, slopes of 1 and a R2 value of 1 (dashed grey line).

**Figure S1.5.** Schematic overview of the different methodological steps of our analyses. a) We prepared distribution data and current and future climate data in order to b) calibrate our species distribution models (SDMs). Based on these models, we c) created projections for current and future conditions (1995 and 2050/2080). In order to perform our analyses, we then d) thresholded the projected probability of occurrence into binary (presence/absence) projected distribution data. In the subsequent steps (e - g), we perform different species-specific analyses to infer information about e) the change in range extent, f) the range overlap between current and future projected distribution and g) the change in range position by assessing the direction and distance of change in range centroid.
