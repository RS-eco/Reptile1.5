**Running head:** Global reptiles under climate change

## Abstract

**Aim:** Until recently, complete information on global reptile distributions has not been widely available. Here, we provide the first comprehensive climate impact assessment for reptiles on a global scale.

**Location:** Global, excluding Antarctica

**Time period:** 1995, 2050, 2080

**Major taxa studied:** Reptiles

**Methods:** We modelled the distribution of 6,296 reptile species and assessed potential global as well as realm-specific changes in species richness, the change in global species richness across climate space, and species-specific changes in range extent, overlap and position under future climate change. To assess the future climatic impact on 3,768 range-restricted species, which could not be modelled, we compared the future change in climatic conditions between both modelled and non-modelled species.

**Results:** Reptile richness was projected to decline significantly over time, globally but also for most zoogeographic realms, with the greatest decrease in Brazil, Australia and South Africa. Species richness was highest in warm and moist regions, with these regions being projected to shift further towards climate extremes in the future. Range extents were projected to decline considerably in the future, with a low overlap between current and future ranges. Shifts in range centroids differed among realms and taxa, with a dominating global poleward shift. Non-modelled species were significantly stronger affected by projected climatic changes than modelled species.

**Main conclusions:** With ongoing future climate change, reptile richness is likely to decrease significantly across most parts of the world. This effect as well as considerable impacts on species’ range extent, overlap, and position were visible across lizards, snakes and turtles alike. Together with other anthropogenic impacts, such as habitat loss and harvesting of species, this is a cause for concern. Given the historical lack of global reptile distributions, this calls for a re-assessment of global reptile conservation efforts, with a specific focus on anticipated future climate change.

**KEYWORDS:** bioclim, biodiversity, environmental niche model, global warming, ISIMIP, lizard, snake, species distribution model, species richness, turtle

**Figure 1.** a) Map of projected global terrestrial reptile species richness (1995), b) frequency of species richness by taxonomic group (lizard, snake, turtle and total) with mean values highlighted by vertical line and c) increase, d) decrease, e) net change and f) relative change (%) in reptile species richness for all modelled reptile species (N = 6296) for the year 2080 under a medium representative concentration pathway (RCP6.0) and a medium dispersal scenario (d/8). Results are presented as the ensemble mean, across the four global circulation models (GCMs) and two model algorithms (GAM & GBM) considered. All maps are based on 0.5° x 0.5° grid cells, which have been projected to Mollweide equal‐area projection (EPSG:54009). Grey areas are regions for which no projections are available. Note that the colour scales differ among the individual panels.

**Figure 2.** Terrestrial reptile species richness across the globe and for each zoogeographic realm (Afrotropical, Australian, Madagascan, Nearctic, Neotropical, Oceanian, Oriental, Palearctic, Panamanian, Saharo-Arabian & Sino-Japanese) over time (1995, 2080) based on all modelled reptile species (N = 6296). Results are presented as the ensemble mean across the four global circulation models (GCMs) and two model algorithms (GAM & GBM) considered, under a medium representative concentration pathway (RCP6.0) and a medium dispersal scenario (d/8). The statistical difference between years was tested using a paired Student’s t-test with Holm correction (p < 0.05 = *, p < 0.01 = **, p < 0.001 = ***, p < 0.0001 = ****). Plots show mean (red point & label), median (black horizontal line), 25th to 75th percentiles (box), entire range of data (violin & data points) and density of values (width of violin). Figure 5 provides a map outlining the different zoogeographic realms.

**Figure 3.** Univariate relationship of current (1995) and future (2080 RCP6.0) reptile species richness with a) temperature, b) precipitation; and the bivariate relationship of temperature and precipitation with reptile species richness for c) 1995 and d) 2080 RCP6.0; and the respective e) net richness change and f) relative richness change (%) under a medium dispersal scenario (d/8). Heat maps and lines show the mean and ribbons the standard deviation in variance across space, global circulation models (GCMs) and the two model algorithms (GAM & GBM).

**Figure 4.** Frequency plots of the mean number of reptile species (a) lizard, c) snake, e) turtle) and their potential future change (%) in range extent (total area of occupied grid cells) and the mean number of reptile species (b) lizard, d) snake, f) turtle) per potential range overlap class (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, 80-100). Error margins/bars indicate the standard deviation across the four global circulation models (GCMs) and the two model algorithms (GAM & GBM) used. Both shown for 2080 under a medium representative concentration pathway (RCP6.0) and a medium dispersal scenario (d/8).

**Figure 5.** Cumulative direction and distance of potential range centroid changes per taxonomic group (a) lizard, b) snake, c) turtle) and d) range centroids (points on map) and the number of species and their directional shift in range centroid position per zoogeographic realm (inset polar plots). Results are presented as the ensemble mean across the four global circulation models (GCMs) and two model algorithms (GAM & GBM) considered, for the year 2080 under a medium representative concentration pathway (RCP6.0) and a medium dispersal scenario (d/8). The inset bar chart shows the number of species that have their range centroid located in the respective realm. Numbers show the total number of species per realm, while the bars are colour coded by the three different taxonomic groups. Please note that a considerable number of species (n = 518) have their range centroid located outside of the zoogeographic realm boundaries and thus were not associated with any realm and so are not considered for the polar plots in Fig. 5 d).

![](figures/Figure6.png)
**Figure 6.** Mean climatic distance for modelled and non-modelled species, split by taxonomic group (a) lizard, b) snake, c) turtle and d) total). The statistical difference between modelled and non-modelled species was tested using a Student’s t-test with Holm correction (p < 0.05 = *, p < 0.01 = **, p < 0.001 = ***, p < 0.0001 = ****). Plots show mean (red point & label), median (black horizontal line), 25th to 75th percentiles (box), entire range of data (violin & data points) and density of values (width of violin). The results are shown as the ensemble mean across the four global circulation models (GCMs) for the year 2080 under a medium representative concentration pathway (RCP6.0).
